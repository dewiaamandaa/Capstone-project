The provision of feed to livestock is a crucial aspect to ensure the quality and well-being of chickens. To guarantee the well-being and quality of poultry, the type of feed provided plays a vital role. Determining the appropriate feed for livestock based on their age and health remains a challenging question for farmers. Meanwhile, the recent increase in livestock consumption has led to higher demand, ultimately becoming a primary factor driving the need to boost livestock production. Therefore, our team plans to introduce an application that can offer effective feed recommendations tailored to the current condition of the livestock.
This application aims to offer accurate and effective recommendations for the type of feed that aligns with the current conditions of the livestock, considering factors such as age and health. Leveraging technology, our goal is to empower farmers with a user-friendly and informative solution. The application is not only intended to assist in making informed decisions about feed but also to contribute to the overall welfare and productivity of the livestock. Through this initiative, we hope to bridge the gap between the complexities of poultry farming and the increasing demand for high-quality livestock products.
